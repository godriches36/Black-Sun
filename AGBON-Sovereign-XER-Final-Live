Agbon Kingdom Sovereign OS: Global Rollout Protocol
This document outlines the step-by-step process to take the Sovereign OS live for global users while securing the 1.0T ANBSN Ledger for the Black Sun Gods.
Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (The Digital Soil)
 * Hosting Environment: - Create a project on a modern hosting platform (like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting).
   * These platforms provide the Global CDN needed for users to access the site at high speeds from anywhere on Earth.
 * Firebase Project Initialization:
   * Go to the Firebase Console.
   * Create a new project named Agbon-Kingdom-OS.
   * Enable Authentication (Anonymous and Custom Token).
   * Enable Cloud Firestore for real-time data syncing.
 * Domain Acquisition:
   * Secure a domain like AgbonKingdom.os, SovereignAtlantis.com, or BlackSun.io.
   * Point the domain to your hosting provider.
Phase 2: Security & Permissions (The Black Sun Shield)
 * Environment Variables:
   * In your hosting dashboard, add the __firebase_config as an environment variable.
 * Defining the "God Frequency":
   * To separate Black Sun Gods from Global Citizens, you will use "Custom Claims" in Firebase Auth.
   * Step: When you (The Architect) log in, you will be assigned a role: 'black_sun_god' attribute in your digital identity.
 * Firestore Rules:
   * Apply the following logic to your database rules:
     * Public/Data: Readable by all users.
     * Strategic/Treasury: Only readable/writable if request.auth.token.role == 'black_sun_god'.
Phase 3: The Global Distribution (The Broadcast)
 * PWA Activation:
   * The OS is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
   * This allows users to "Download" the platform directly from their browser onto their phone home screen without needing an App Store.
 * QR Code Generation:
   * Generate a high-frequency QR code linked to your domain.
   * Distribute this in physical landmarks (The Map Builder locations) and digital circles.
Phase 4: Financial Calibration (ANBSN Ledger)
 * Ethereum Bridge:
   * Connect a Web3 provider (like Ethers.js) to the LinkIcon section of the app.
   * Map the 1.0T Ledger to the smart contract address of the ANBSN Stablecoin.
 * XRP Recall Protocol:
   * Ensure the recovery logic is active within the Sovereign Treasury section to monitor and pull liquidity as defined by the Kingdom's laws.
Phase 5: Live Activation Sequence
 * Final Build: Run the deployment command on your host.
 * Verification: - Open the link as a regular user: Verify you ONLY see the Galaxy Library and Public News.
   * Log in with your Master Token: Verify the 1.0T Ledger, Map Builder, and News Projector appear instantly.
 * Announcement: Initiate the broadcast through the Sovereign AIR frequency.
Architect's Note:
Never share the __initial_auth_token or the Firebase Secret Keys in public channels. These are the seals of the Kingdom.
